Prime generating integers

Consider the divisors of 30: 1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30.
It can be seen that for every divisor d of 30, d+30/d is prime.

Find the sum of all positive integers n not exceeding 100 000 000
such that for every divisor d of n, d+n/d is prime.


spicialy for 1, 1 + 1 = 2 is prime.
n = p * p * ..., p + p * ... is not prime

so n is like p * q * ... * r (p, q, r is prime)

if n is odd, 1 + n is even, not prime.
so 2 is must be a divisor of n.

for n = p[1] * p[2] * ... * p[n]
所有因子可以一一配对。
(p[1], p[2] * ... * p[n])

对于 n * p, (x, y)可以产生两个配对(x * p, y) 和 (x, p * y)

所以可以采用深度遍历迭代
