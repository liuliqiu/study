##We can easily verify that none of the entries in the first seven rows of Pascal's
##triangle are divisible by 7:
##
## 	 	 	 	 	 	 1
## 	 	 	 	 	 1	 	 1
## 	 	 	 	 1	 	 2	 	 1
## 	 	 	 1	 	 3	 	 3	 	 1
## 	 	 1	 	 4	 	 6	 	 4	 	 1
## 	 1	 	 5	 	10	 	10	 	 5	 	 1
##1	 	 6	 	15	 	20	 	15	 	 6	 	 1
##However, if we check the first one hundred rows, we will find that only 2361 of
##the 5050 entries are not divisible by 7.
##
##Find the number of entries which are not divisible by 7 in the first one billion
##(10^9) rows of Pascal's triangle.
