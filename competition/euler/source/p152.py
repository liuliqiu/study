"""
Writing 1/2 as a sum of inverse squares
How many ways are there to write the number 1/2 as a sum of inverse squares,
using distinct integers between 2 and 80 inclusive?

{2,3,4,5,7,12,15,20,28,35}
{2,3,4,6,7,9,10,20,28,35,36,45}
{2,3,4,6,7,9,12,15,28,30,35,36,45}

Because 1 / 2 > sum(1 / (x * x) for x in count(3)), 2 must in the integersã€‚
so the question equal write the number 1 / 4 as a sum of inverse squares,
using distinct integers between 3 and 80 inclusive?
