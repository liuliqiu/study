##In England the currency is made up of pound, £, and pence, p, and there are
##eight coins in general circulation:
##1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p) and £2 (200p).
##It is possible to make £2 in the following way:
##1*£1 + 1*50p + 2*20p + 1*5p + 1*2p + 3*1p
##How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?

moneys = [1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200]


def fi(x, v):
    if x == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return sum([fi(x - i, i) for i in moneys if i <= x and i <= v])


print(fi(200, 200))
