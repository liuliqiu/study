##The palindromic number 595 is interesting because it can be written as the sum
##of consecutive squares: 6^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 10^2 + 11^2 + 12^2.
##
##There are exactly eleven palindromes below one-thousand that can be written as
##consecutive square sums, and the sum of these palindromes is 4164. Note that 1
##= 0^2 + 1^2 has not been included as this problem is concerned with the squares
##of positive integers.
##
##Find the sum of all the numbers less than 108 that are both palindromic and can
##be written as the sum of consecutive squares.
