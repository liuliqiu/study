##If we take 47, reverse and add, 47 + 74 = 121, which is palindromic.
##Not all numbers produce palindromes so quickly. For example,
##349 + 943 = 1292,
##1292 + 2921 = 4213
##4213 + 3124 = 7337
##That is, 349 took three iterations to arrive at a palindrome.
##Although no one has proved it yet, it is thought that some numbers, like 196,
##never produce a palindrome. A number that never forms a palindrome through the
##reverse and add process is called a Lychrel number. Due to the theoretical
##nature of these numbers, and for the purpose of this problem, we shall assume
##that a number is Lychrel until proven otherwise. In addition you are given
##that for every number below ten-thousand, it will either (i) become a palindrome
##in less than fifty iterations, or, (ii) no one, with all the computing power
##that exists, has managed so far to map it to a palindrome. In fact, 10677 is
##the first number to be shown to require over fifty iterations before producing
##a palindrome: 4668731596684224866951378664 (53 iterations, 28-digits).
##Surprisingly, there are palindromic numbers that are themselves Lychrel numbers; the
##first example is 4994.
##How many Lychrel numbers are there below ten-thousand?
##NOTE: Wording was modified slightly on 24 April 2007 to emphasise the
##theoretical nature of Lychrel numbers.
