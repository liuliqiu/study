##The fraction 49/98 is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced mathematician in
##attempting to simplify it may incorrectly believe that 49/98 = 4/8, which is
##correct, is obtained by cancelling the 9s.
##We shall consider fractions like, 30/50 = 3/5, to be trivial examples.
##There are exactly four non-trivial examples of this type of fraction, less
##than one in value, and containing two digits in the numerator and denominator.
##If the product of these four fractions is given in its lowest common terms,
##find the value of the denominator.
