##A common security method used for online banking is to ask the user for three
##random characters from a passcode. For example, if the passcode was 531278,
##they may ask for the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th characters; the expected reply would be:
##317.
##The text file, keylog.txt, contains fifty successful login attempts.
##Given that the three characters are always asked for in order, analyse the
##file so as to determine the shortest possible secret passcode of unknown length.
