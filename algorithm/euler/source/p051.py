##By replacing the 1st digit of *3, it turns out that six of the nine possible
##values: 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83, are all prime.
##By replacing the 3rd and 4th digits of 56**3 with the same digit, this 5-digit
##number is the first example having seven primes among the ten generated numbers,
##yielding the family: 56003, 56113, 56333, 56443, 56663, 56773, and 56993.
##Consequently 56003, being the first member of this family, is the smallest
##prime with this property.
##Find the smallest prime which, by replacing part of the number (not necessarily
##adjacent digits) with the same digit, is part of an eight prime value family.
