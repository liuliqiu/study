##We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the
##digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1
##through 5 pandigital.
##The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39  186 = 7254, containing
##multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.
##Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity
##can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.
##HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only
##include it once in your sum.
