##Euler published the remarkable quadratic formula:
##n² + n + 41
##It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive values
##n = 0 to 39. However, when n = 40, 402 + 40 + 41 = 40(40 + 1) + 41 is
##divisible by 41, and certainly when n = 41, 41² + 41 + 41 is clearly divisible
##by 41.
##Using computers, the incredible formula  n²  79n + 1601 was discovered, which
##produces 80 primes for the consecutive values n = 0 to 79. The product of the
##coefficients, 79 and 1601, is 126479.
##Considering quadratics of the form:
##n² + an + b, where |a|  1000 and |b|  1000
##where |n| is the modulus/absolute value of n
##e.g. |11| = 11 and |4| = 4
##Find the product of the coefficients, a and b, for the quadratic expression that
##produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of n,
##starting with n = 0.
