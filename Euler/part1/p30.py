##Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of
##fourth powers of their digits:
##1634 = 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4
##8208 = 8^4 + 2^4 + 0^4 + 8^4
##9474 = 9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4
##As 1 = 14 is not a sum it is not included.
##The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.
##Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth
##powers of their digits.
