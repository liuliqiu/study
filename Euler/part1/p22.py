##Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 46K text file
##containing over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it into
##alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for each name,
##multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name
##score.
##For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which
##is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN
##would obtain a score of 938*53 = 49714.
##What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
