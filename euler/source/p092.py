##A number chain is created by continuously adding the square of the digits in a
##number to form a new number until it has been seen before.
##For example,
##44→32→13→10→1→1
##85→89→145→42→20→4→16→37→58→89
##Therefore any chain that arrives at 1 or 89 will become stuck in an endless
##loop. What is most amazing is that EVERY starting number will eventually
##arrive at 1 or 89.
##How many starting numbers below ten million will arrive at 89?
